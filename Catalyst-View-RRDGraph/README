NAME
    Catalyst::View::RRDGraph - RRD Graph View Class

SYNOPSIS
    use the helper to create your View myapp_create.pl view RRDGraph
    RRDGraph

    from the controller:

      sub routine :Local {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;
    
        $c->stash->{'graph'} = [
                "--lower-limit", "0",
                "--start", "end-1d",
                "--vertical-label", "My Label",

                "--width", 300,
                "DEF:Data=/path/to/rrd.rrd:data:AVERAGE",
                "AREA:Data#0000FF:Data "
        ];
        $c->forward('MyApp::View::RRDGraph');
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This view generates RRD graph images from the graph defintion placed in
    the stash. The controller is responsable of placing an ARRAYREF in
    $c-stash->{'graph'}> with the same data as to generate a graph with the
    RRDs module, except for *filename*, that will be automatically generated
    by the view.

CONFIGURATION
    Configurations for the view are:

  IMG_DIR
    Directory to generate temporary image files. Defaults to /tmp/

  IMG_FORMAT
    Image format for the generated files. 'PNG' by default.
